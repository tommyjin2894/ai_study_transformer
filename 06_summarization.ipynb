Yahya Rashid, a UK national from northwest London, was detained at Luton airport on Tuesday after he arrived on a flight from Istanbul, police said. He's been charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, and with engaging in conduct with the intention of assisting others to commit acts of terrorism. Both charges relate to the period between November 1 and March 31. Rashid is due to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, police said.

       "['(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids\\' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won\\'t consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl\\'s seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can stil',\n",

Baby-faced: This little boy has amassed more than 3,000 followers on Twitter with pictures like these . In many pictures he is smoking suspicious substances, with captions such as 'High Life' Backlash: The boy, from Memphis, has prompted a wave of critics calling his stunts 'sad' In one video he laughs and points the gun at the camera in an apparent attempt to look menacing - as adults laugh in the background. In others, he is pictured blowing smoke, with the caption: 'High Life'. Tweets include the phrases, 'I need a bad b****', 'f*** da police', and 'gang sh** n****'. Some feature sexual references, such as: 'quit suckin my d***'. As he is a minor, DailyMail.com will not identify the little boy. The child's tweets have prompted backlash from other Twitter users and members of the community. One woman tweeted him: 'you need help i feel so bad for you your parents should be ashamed please get help and a education this is sad and disappointing.' Another Twitter user said: 'You poor baby.

And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued.

Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house.

The 43-year-old's body was found in January 1996\\xa0by relatives who broke into her flat after becoming increasingly worried about her whereabouts. It was discovered in a wardrobe in her bedroom. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court alongside Christopher Moody. Both men lodged with Ms Comfort in the two months before her death and had a key to the property, the court heard at the time. Kerr served 15 years before being moved to approved premises 90 miles away. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court (above) alongside Christopher Moody in 1998 . During the search he was described by police as a 'very dangerous man' and the public were warned not to approach him. They added that he needed to be\\xa0returned to prison 'as a matter of urgency'. Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke, of North Yorkshire Police,  led the search for Kerr. He said: 'Thanks to some information received following the Crimewatch appeal we were able to track Kerr to a specific area of London. 'The information was vital to the effort to trace Kerr as he indicated when he was arrested that he was about to leave the London area after seeing himself on Crimewatch.

'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.'

The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority.

There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' \",\n",

The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. In fact, reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico's seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. To this day, it's still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. These traits have affected not only the crabs' market value but also likely their ability to survive. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious.

A seven-year-old British boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the French resort of Flaine near Geneva (pictured above). He fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents . Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family. Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine. One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts. His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search. At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis. He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff.

While it sounds like science fiction, these planets may offer scientists a new avenue in their search for alien life. The warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials . This is according to Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist with the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France, who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets. Writing in Aeon, he says: 'To have any chance of life – at least life like our own – a free-floating Earth would need liquid water.' A planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form, and without the sun, this heat would have to come from its interior. 'A layer of ice on a planet's surface can act as a strong insulator, locking in a planet's heat,' claims Raymond. Globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make rogue more common than first thought.\\xa0Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star .

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York .

'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying.

He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die.

Protesters headed west on 17th Street and were met by New York City Police officers who pushed them back.

Miriam González Durántez is not one to blend into the background. She is known for her bold choices and this exotic look was no exception. The lawyer, wife of the Deputy Prime Minister and mother of three boys, wore a particularly colourful ensemble to a fashion show and award gala in central London tonight. Her bright pink, long-sleeved dress was covered in bright blooms at the LDNY fashion show and WIE (Women: Inspiration and Enterprise) award gala at Goldsmiths' Hall celebrating inspirational women and ethical fashion. As if the flower pattern was not enough of a nod to spring, a yellow and pink corsage was pinned to her shoulder. And despite the spring blossoms across the country, this was one of fake flowers. The outfit was accompanied by a £560 pair of Gianvito Rossi Perspex-panelled metallic patent-leather pumps on her feet and a matching thin belt defining her waist. She was pictured tonight with the likes of model Daisy Lowe, designer Kelly Hoppen and Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry. According to The Daily Telegraph, she told an audience: 'Political advisers prefer us to stick to safer ground like kitchens and children. But I much prefer risky ground to political advisers.' And in an article for the Huffington Post written before tonight's event, Miss González Durántez said: 'No matter your age, your skills or your background, every woman has an inner role model and it is the duty of every woman of my generation to stand up for young girls.' She added: 'I decided to support the WIE network (and yes, I am doing this in the middle of a General Election - and no, it is not an oversight).' At the service of thanksgiving for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 the lawyer opted for a pillar-box red dress, with a fabric corsage on the neckline - in contrast to the more sombre colours surrounding her.

The image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 inside a stellar 'breeding ground' called Gum 29, 20,000 light-years from Earth. In the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars. Scroll down for video . A stellar nursery of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 located about 20,000 light-years from the planet earth in the constellation Carina is shown in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, released today to celebrate the silver anniversary of Hubble's launch . Hubble was launched on 24 April 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. Despite a shaky start, when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape, Hubble soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe, to the delight of scientists and the public alike on Earth. And this latest image is no exception, revealing a fascinating cluster of stars in the constellation Carina. The telescope, when it was first devised, was ambitious to say the least - it is 43ft (12.3 metres) long and 14ft (4.2 metres wide). It orbits Earth at a height of about 345 miles (555km) at a speed of 16,000 mph (27,750km/h), with its instruments finely tuned to account for its movement. It is able to image the universe in near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet. It’s estimated that the telescope can continue operating until 2020, when it will overlap with the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2018. 'Hubble has completely transformed our view of the universe,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate. 'This vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing Hubble science.' Hubble captured the image using its Wide Field Camera \",\n",

Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including giving guided tours to visitors, for no extra money. Union chiefs claim workers earn as little as £14,700 despite working the ‘country’s richest family’. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay . Their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors, conducting security searches, telling people about the history of the Castle, and handing out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free, such as leading paid-for tours, carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors. Now, staff have voted ‘overwhelmingly’ in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered ‘years of pay restraint’. The PCS said 76 wardens out of 180 at the Castle will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower and will instead ‘work to rule – meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family (pictured at the Castle) should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' Wardens are also considering causing ‘disruption’ and ‘long queues’ by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and ‘observing every single check they are supposed to do’ – slowing down visitors’ entry to the Castle.

Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 .

When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy.

He pulled back the stroller\\'s cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let\\'s get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev\\'s difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev\\'s relatives arrived at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it\\'s not clear if they plan to testify.

South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa.

Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video . Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner . Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning .

It’s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history.

The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners’ strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they’re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: ‘Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.’ I’m sure Pride isn’t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies — Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour.

       " '(CNN)The public outrage over the \"religious freedom\" bills recently passed in Arkansas and Indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard, judging by their confused and contradictory responses. As poll watchers, they surely knew that most Americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago. But the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses, including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality. They had better adjust to a new reality. For the past three decades, socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations, environmental initiatives and social welfare programs, while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in America\\'s population. For many, this alliance been puzzling: Other, equally devout Christians who place more emphasis on Jesus Christ\\'s message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor, have been uncomfortable with it, as have many business leaders. Their priorities, after all, are based on the bottom line. And companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line. Hence, after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples, the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift, from groups as diverse as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Indiana Pacers, Walmart, Eli Lilly, Apple and even the Marriott International hotel chain.

       " \"It is seen as extremely rude in most human societies, but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear. Gibbons - better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit - have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication. The apes, which are found in the forest of south east Asia, produce a variety of soft call types, known as 'hoos', that are almost inaudible to the human ear. Scroll down for video . Lars gibbons like this one in Khao Yai National Park Thailand use soft 'hoo' calls that are similar to whispers . Yet scientists have found the animals use these whispers to communicate specific information to each other about predators, foraging and when meeting neighbours. The researchers found that predator 'hoos' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey. A dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists. Researchers at Wisconsin University in Madison have been using computer algorithms to analyse the whoops and songs produced by the apes. Gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes, particularly in response to predators. This usually starts with a series of soft 'hoo' noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder. In most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song. This suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alerting the raptors. Similarly biologists studying lar gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area. Dr Esther Clarke, who led the research at the University of Durham, said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers.

The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League – the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled – may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere .

So, in the middle of Holy Week, I decided to finally take the plunge. Let me explain. My name is Laura Bernardini and I'm a director of coverage at CNN, which means I manage our newsgathering and newsroom in Washington. I'm also a lifelong Catholic. At work this week, I was talking with some colleagues about Pope Francis' upcoming trip to the United States.  During the course of that conversation, I admitted something that has privately bothered me for a long time. I have never read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. This from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest-ranking Catholic in the bureau. My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday. And there are so many people that can so effortlessly quote long and beautiful passages. I love to read, there is no excuse. Still, it made me wonder: Why I had not read the Good Book cover to cover? I took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my Catholic high school, but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about. Later, when I graduated, my grandparents gave me a beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington. But in 24 years, I never so much as cracked the cover, other than to write the date I received the gift. In that newsroom conversation this week, Daniel Burke, the religion editor at CNN.com, suggested I read the Bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for Belief. I will admit to being pretty stunned and a little scared at the prospect. I figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process. I am no scholar, no expert on scripture, as should be obvious. But the more we talked, the more the idea grew on me.

The other boldface name in the group is Google, which comes in at no. 13 and pays an median of $143,000 a year. But to make it on to the payrolls of these top companies, workers needs to be highly educated, highly skilled or highly connected - sometimes all three. They fall into three categories - tech companies, law firms and consulting firms. Netflix has come a long way from its days of mailing DVDs to subscribers across the country. Its 2,000 employees have a median salary of $180,000 now . Nine of the top 15 companies are in the tech sector, according to salary data compiled by the recruiting company Glassdoor.com. These firms are competing furiously to hire and retain the relatively small number of top-notch computer programmers who make Silicon Valley such a magnet for money. Consulting and law firms rely on relationships with clients and so once employees establish themselves, they become more and more valuable and command higher salaries. Wall Street law firm, Skadden, Arps, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the nation, comes in at the top of the list. The median compensation there there is $182,000. Skadden has 4,500 employees - more than 1,800 of whom are high-grossing attorneys. Netflix, which has 2,000 employees, comes in second. Management consultants take the three spots - Strategy&, McKinsey & Company and A.T. Kearney all pay $160,000 median salaries. Mozilla, the company that oversees the Firefox web browser and TureCar, which lists car sales, are both on the list.

Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute.

Two prototypes of the CYG-11 seaplane were tested this week over the sea off the coast of Haikou in Hainan Province in China. The aircraft is believed to be a joint project between Russia and China to build new types of super-efficient seaplane. The CYG-11 seaplane (above) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide . The vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft's wings are close to the ground. Length: 13m . Wingspan: 15.6 m . Weight: 3800 kg . Seats: 12 people . Maximum load: 1200 kg . Maximum range: 1500 km . Flight speed: 175 - 250 km/h . Flight height: 3-5 m . Wave height: 1.25 - 3 m . By placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft, this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air. Engineers behind the CNY 5 billion (£500 million) project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles (100 km) on 28 litres of fuel. With a maximum range of 930 miles (1,500 km), the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). The aircraft races over the wavetops at a height of between three to five metres (9-15 feet).

Dr Ken Collins, Senior Research Fellow and Diving Officer at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline: \\'This is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish, the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark. \\'Something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential “enemy\". \\'Flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks.\\' Fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour, such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate.

Alex got this response when he asked the Russian-language version of 'Siri, gay clubs around me?' His iPad version of the Apple personal assistant told him of swearing when he asked how he could register a gay marriage in England . 'However, in Russian it turns out to be quite homophobic.' He asks Siri in Russian 'Is gay marriage normal?' and gets the response: 'I believe this emotion should be considered negative.' To the question 'How do you register a gay marriage in England?' Siri replies 'So, now you're swearing obscenities and you're going to eat with these very hands!' The same query also gets the response 'I will pretend I didn't hear that', while the Apple user is told 'Alex, you are so rude!' in reply to the question 'Siri, tell me about gay marriage'. He also asks 'Siri, gay clubs around me?' and is told 'I would have turned red if I could'. Alex says at the end of the nearly two minute clip: 'This is happening in London.

Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’ Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996.

Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month.

Officer Michael Slager was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at Walter Scott as Scott ran away from a traffic stop. The video footage contradicts Slager\\'s statement that he felt threatened after Scott allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle.  The Post and Courier reported that the FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the State Law Enforcement Division, while the South Carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations. Now, after watching the footage — which should remain in your memory for a long time to come — one could say that Slager shot Scott like a dog.  But then again, dogs usually are not treated this badly.  But the man was shot like a runaway slave. In this case, there was clear documented evidence of what occurred, and no room for fabrications.  Most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable.  The police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death, or like Slager, apparently place a Taser near Scott\\'s body and concoct some story that his life was in danger. \"We can\\'t bring Mr. Scott back, but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with Mr. Scott.

The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater. But interestingly, the rover’s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to spot the rover on the surface. It is seen here in the full image, circled. The rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock . The image was taken using the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise) camera on the Martian satellite, from a height of 187 miles (300km) above the surface. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. It is not the first time it has spotted Curiosity, or indeed other rovers, on the surface - but it is the first time in 2015.

Lawsuit:\\xa0A student expelled from GMU for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault (file) The lawsuit comes as colleges across the country, and particularly in Virginia, are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault. The University of Virginia implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now-discredited Rolling Stone article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party. The sexual misconduct allegations at George Mason stem from an October 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student's dorm room on the Fairfax campus. At one point, according to the lawsuit, she pushed him away but didn't invoke her safe word. Later that night, the two engaged in a second sex act, in which the male student asked her if she was interested, and she replied, 'I don't know.'

       " \"Sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand-crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven. But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose. The second I see the word ‘spicy’ on a bottle label (which suggests an oaky flavouring), I instantly know the price will be much higher. A £5 bottle has suddenly become £12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling. So when I read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to ‘oak age’ wine in hours rather than years, my curiosity was seriously roused. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour — a process that can take up to two years — in just a day or two. Who wouldn’t drink to that? Scroll down for video . TV wine expert Oz Clarke puts to the test this oak bottle that claims to 'oak age' wine in hours rather than years . The product, which retails at £50, is the brainchild of 30-year-old entrepreneur Joel Paglione. Growing up on his parents’ vineyard in Canada, Joel became fascinated by the process of ageing wine. Watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking, he wondered why the wine couldn’t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it. When Mr Paglione Snr explained that the smaller the oak barrel, the faster the oak infusion, Joel got his Eureka moment. How about a bottle made out of oak which will ‘oak age’ a single bottle in a fraction of the time? Now, after three years of experimenting, Joel has developed what he claims is the ‘smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made.’ The idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle, leave for up to 48 hours (depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy) and — hey presto! — your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year’s grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world-class vine\",\n",

But now they may have to make room for an addition to Shakespeare\\'s famous oeuvre. New research indicates that \"Double Falsehood,\" a play first published in 1728 by Lewis Theobald, was actually written more than a century earlier by Shakespeare himself with help from his friend John Fletcher. The findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the \"newer\" play. \"The match between the \\'Double Falsehood\\' play and Shakespeare was a landslide. It was shockingly clear,\" said Ryan L. Boyd, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. The study, co-authored by Boyd and UT colleague James W. Pennebaker, was published in the journal Psychological Science. \"There\\'s very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently.\" Boyd said he and Pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobald to create a \"psychological signature\" of each author based on word choices, phrase patterns and other factors. They compared those profiles to the language in \"Double Falsehood\" and determined that the play\\'s first half was almost entirely written by Shakespeare, though the second half appeared to be split evenly between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Only tiny traces of Theobald\\'s signature were found. \"We\\'re certainly not suggesting that Theobald didn\\'t make edits,\" Boyd told CNN. \"But he clearly did not write it.\" \"Double Falsehood,\" also known as \"The Distressed Lovers,\" is based on the \"Cardenio\" section of Don Quixote, the classic 17th-century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Set in Spain, the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers: one virtuous, one sinful. Theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered,',\n",

       " 'Breakthrough?: Early tests carried out on cancer cells (like the one pictured) have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent . A new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists. It harnesses the power of the body’s immune system and targets it at tumours. Early experiments have demonstrated that the new method could revolutionise cancer care. Scientists have found a system of priming the body’s immune system to recognise, attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung, skin and bowel tumours. The team which carried out the research found that early trials ‘profoundly retarded’ tumour growth in mice. Survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent, according to results published in the journal Nature last night. The scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans. British experts said it is the most promising sign yet that ‘personal’ treatments may be effective in treating a wide range of cancers. Until now most cancer drugs have been designed according to the type of tumour they are attacking – a broad-brush approach in which the type of drug is selected depending on the body part in which the tumour is sited. But the new focus on personal cancer therapy instead aims to harness each individual’s immune system and give it a boost depending on the genetic make-up of the tumour itself. The ground-breaking technique may provide a universal blueprint for vaccines that can target a wide range of human cancers. And it overcomes the problem of cancer presenting an ever-moving target that constantly evolves to evade the immune system. Scientists last night welcomed the German team’s breakthrough. Professor Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ‘This study provides the first evidence that we may be on the threshold of being able to produce individualised vaccines directed against specific mutations present in a patient’s',\n",

       " \"Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few adopt the electronic devices as habit, a new study has found . Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few become regular users, scientists have discovered. In fact, they found most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers. This suggests young people are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits - nor are they  getting hooked on them after initially trying them. Researchers examined data from two nationally representative surveys of primary and secondary schoolchildren from more than 150 schools across Wales. In all, 1,601 children aged 10 to 11 and 9,055 children aged 11 to 16 were quizzed about their use of e-cigarettes. Experts at Cardiff University found use of e-cigarettes at least once was more common than having smoked a conventional cigarette in all age groups, bar the oldest (15 to 16 year olds). Almost six per cent of 10 to 11 year olds had tried e-cigarettes, far more than had been tempted by tobacco (1.6 per cent). Meanwhile, 12 per cent of 11 to 16 year olds said they had used e-cigarettes, irrespective of gender, ethnic background, or family affluence. This is in contrast with the pattern seen in smokers, where all these factors come into play. The researchers said it suggests e-cigarettes may have a wider appeal across all sectors of the teenage population. The proportion of teens who used e-cigarettes, but who had never smoked, rose from 5 per cent among 10 to 11 year olds, to eight per cent among 15 to 16 year olds. But only 1.5 per cent of those aged 11 to 16 said they regularly used the electronic devices - defined as at least once a month. The researchers note their findings suggest 'e-cigarettes are unlikely to make a major, direct contribution to adolescent nicotine addiction at present'. They note the World Health Organisation recognise there is little evidence as to whether e-cigarettes may or may not act as a gateway to conventional sm\",\n",

The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers.

On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus.

'To have battled out of the group as we did (Bath lost their first two games) and then obviously to get into the quarter-final, to get so close and then fail at the end, it is obviously massively disappointing.

Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El\\xa0Mirón' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC.

Pakistani security personnel escort Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as he leaves court after a hearing in Islamabad on January 1 . LeT's charitable wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), confirmed Lakhvi's release. A senior JuD official said: 'Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has been released from jail. He is free now and in a secure place. We can't say exactly where he is at the moment for security reasons.' Another official said Lakhvi would receive a hero's welcome when he arrived at JuD headquarters. It comes after nearly four months of wrangling over Lakhvi's detention after a judge granted him bail in December, sparking an angry response from New Delhi. Pakistan's government slapped Lakhvi with a series of detention orders but judges repeatedly cancelled them. On Thursday the Lahore High Court ordered his release, conditional on a two million rupee (32,000 U.S. dollars or £22,000) bond. India has long seethed at Pakistan's failure either to hand over or prosecute those accused of planning and organising the Mumbai attacks. A spokesman for India's home ministry, who asked not to be named, condemned Lakhvi's release. They said: 'This is a very disappointing announcement.

It was a \"penetrating wound,\" with the intestines protruding. \"Every time we tried hands-on, he resisted that type of treatment,\" Sullivan said. \"He was yelling, loud, like an \\'rrrrrrrr\\' type of thing.

       " \"For most of us the thought of eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far. But the consumption of locusts, crickets, worms and grubs could become very much a part of our diet as the cost of meat production rises, and the demand for meat grows. In tonight's final episode of BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaws – Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred – who have travelled from the 1950s to the end of the millennium are served the food of the future. The Robshaws sample insects in tonight's episode of\\xa0BBC Two's Back for Dinner . Two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Presenter Giles Coren and food historian Polly Russell serve the family a radical dinner of Mexican spiced cricket tacos, Asian worm stir fry, buffalo worm tart and cricket kebabs. The family also attempt burgers made with a mixture of insect and beef protein, and sample cookies made from insect flour. 'In the future meat supplies might be a problem,' presenter Mr Coren says in the programme. 'Insects have been hailed as a solution to our meat problem; full of protein, low in fat and packed full of nutrients they are already part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Asia.' The lack of traditional meat proteins can be put down to population expansion, food historian Polly Russell explains. 'As populations grow globally there is a huge pressure on the amount of meat that is produced because as developing countries start getting richer and people start adopting Western-style diets, which tend to consume a lot more meat,' she said. Entomophagy (eating insects) could have a positive impact on the environment and world hunger if crunchy exoskeletons could replace typical meat.

Panda Lu Lu (right) mated with female partner Zhen Zhen for nearly eight minutes, setting a new centre record . Lu Lu has been bestowed the name 'The Enduring Brother' after his sexual prowess hit the headlines . It also means the Chinese panda lasts longer than the average American man in bed, with your typical New Mexico man making love for just over seven minutes, according to research printed by The Daily Dot. The pair were pitted against another couple of pandas, Yi Bao and Jin Xin, who only managed one minute and 20 seconds of love-making. The average length of a 'romp' between two pandas is between 30 seconds and five minutes, making Lu Lu's efforts all the more impressive. Breeders said they watch the creatures having sex so they can understand their mating habits, and encourage them to reproduce in the future. A breeder at the Sichuan Giant Panda Research Centre watches close as Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen begin . They use poles made of bamboo to guide the pandas towards each other, when they have tracked when the pandas are in the amorous mood. The female of the species are prone to making loud and strange noises, while male pandas leave traces of their scent to attract the opposite sex.

Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze. It was a day I have often tried to forget, but it was the one I must always remember. Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire, it was inevitable I would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match I was commentating on for Yorkshire Television. What I did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident, as Martin Fletcher has done with his book Fifty-Six, the Story of the Bradford Fire. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything I have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately. On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. Without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. I find it abhorrent that Stafford Heginbotham’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grievin\",\n",

       " 'Various types of renewable energy such as solar and wind are often touted as being the solution to the world’s growing energy crisis. But one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock. By harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss, he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere. A University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy. By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce . Dr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries. His idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process. And the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. The Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015. It sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for £3 - the ‘price of a pint’. Dr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part. This year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries.

Rules laid down by Transport for London (TfL) mean refugees and those applying for asylum do not have to reveal whether they have a criminal history when trying to become a cab driver. The legal loophole in an official application document on 'private hire driver licensing' says people coming to Britain will not be required to have their criminal convictions checked. Asylum seekers and refugees applying to be minicab drivers are exempt from criminal records checks . The form, seen by the Daily Express, states: 'With regards to overseas criminal records checks, no such checks will be made in respect of those applicants who declare that they are in possession of or who have applied for refugee or asylum status.' Everyone else who applies for a cab licence must undergo criminal records checks. Those from outside the EU who have spent more than three months abroad over the last three years have to provide a 'letter of good conduct' from their home country. This usually requires their country of origin to give a reference to the Home Office, revealing whether the applicant has a criminal history. But asylum seekers and refugees are exempt from this too, according to a second document. A TfL guide on taxi and private hire applications states: 'Any applicant who has been granted or is awaiting a decision to be granted asylum/refugee status will not be required to produce a Certificate of Good Conduct from the country he is claiming asylum from.'

Cook plays a shot during a training session at the Grenada National Stadium in St Georges on Monday . In this scenario, because his front foot is still landing as the ball is halfway down, he is forced to play the shot with his hands away from his body, which is when you're most likely to nick the ball to the wicketkeeper or slips. He's clearly trying to open up his shoulders — perhaps he felt a bit closed off last summer — but he moved his front foot way too far against the West Indies and when you're out of nick and under pressure, your movements become exaggerated. It's important to note that in the second picture he has already started to move, making his footwork look worse than it is, but also that Cook has never been a brilliant front-foot player. He's at his best when he gets his movements out of the way early, giving him time to move to the pitch of the ball and bend his front knee into the drive.

This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible.

Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again.

Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country\\'s residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that \"many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time.\" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\\'s definition. But by Thursday, the winds\\' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. \"This will not be a catastrophic storm,\" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others.

With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could ‘smell’ something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal’s board don’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal’s money like it’s his own, is similarly ambitious. A\",\n",

Chelsea are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but Pardew, whose Palace side host City on Monday, believes the race is far from over. Alan Pardew cups his ears during a clash between Crystal Palace against Stoke and the Eagles boss has refused to rule Manchester City out of the title race .

But time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse. This time the stage was set in North Charleston, South Carolina, a city of about 100,000 people. Walter Scott was stopped by Officer Michael Slager for a broken taillight, and within minutes Scott was dead. According to the incident report, Slager said: \"Shots fired, and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" His attorney at the time, David Aylor, said that Slager \"felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.\" But then came the video. We watched in horror as we saw Slager shoot Scott in the back multiple times. Then we saw Slager pick up something from one location and place it near Scott\\'s lifeless body. On Tuesday, the officer was arrested on murder charges. North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters, \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw.\" Apparently so was Slager\\'s attorney, who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer. After the video became public, the officials in North Charleston deftly handled the situation. However, it was an easy case. There is no plausible evidence that Slager feared for his life when Scott is seen running away.

If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.'

A Washington high school teacher is being hailed a hero for tackling a 16-year-old student to the ground after he opened fire on Monday morning. No one was injured after the boy shot twice toward the ceiling in the school commons before classes began at North Thurston High School in Lacey, about 60 miles southwest of Seattle, authorities said. Brady Olson, who teaches Advanced Placement government and civics at the school, knocked the armed student to the ground and kept him pinned down until authorities arrived, witnesses said. The shooter is in custody at the Lacey Police Station. The teenager, who has not been identified, only transferred to the high school a month ago, according to authorities. He later told police he shot into the air because he didn't want to hurt anyone. A search warrant is being carried out at his home, police said. School district spokesperson Courtney Schrieve confirmed that the 43-year-old teacher had been responsible for helping apprehend the student. 'He is a very brave man who probably saved a lot of people today,' Schrieve told KCPQ. Both students and staff said they were not surprised that Olson, who has taught at the school for nine years, was the one to stop the shooter. 'If anyone in the school were to do something like he did, I would think it would be him,' said student Teia Patan, 17, who is in one of Olson's classes.

A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples – including Mr and Mrs Phillips – for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met.

The memo for members of Congress states damningly that ‘the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda’. Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain’s General Election, the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament. Scroll down for video . The 'special relationship' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan . The document – prepared by the Congressional Research Service, an in-house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators – states that while Britain and the US are likely to ‘remain key economic partners’, a ‘reassessment of the special relationship may be in order… because its geopolitical setting has been changing’. The memo, edited by Derek E Mix, the CRS’s chief European affairs analyst, says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the ‘influence and centrality of the relationship’. It also states that the UK’s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy – and Chancellor George Osborne’s implementation of spending cuts. It reads: ‘A significant degree of the UK’s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy, further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food  during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011.\\xa0When Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘stronger than it has ever been’ Winston Churchill first coi\",\n",

Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit.

Corrales then said he got out of his car at a red light to take the license plate number, while Muller disputes this and claims the man followed him into the casino parking light. That is when things intensified between the two. 'He turned the wheels and I heard wheels screeching,' Corrales said. 'He hit me with the car and took off with me on the car and he was going fast.' Corrlaes claims he held on the windshield wipers to make sure he did not fall off the car, and a few blocks later Muller stooped and he was able to get off. He said of the incident; 'Seriously, the dude wanted to kill me. The look on his face was pure hate. There was an older woman and a kid in the car and I could hear them screaming at him to stop.'

And wiretaps and other intelligence revealed that the group planned to carry out terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in Italy, according to Caligari Chief Prosecutor Mauro Mura. Some evidence indicated the Vatican was among the targets considered, police said. Talk of this took place March 2010, around the time a possible suicide bomber from Afghanistan entered Italy, Mura said.

Cummings said that Gray joined the church in 2001. He was in youth choir and was a junior usher. \"He loved church,\" Cummings said. Gray also played football. \"Did you see him?\" the representative asked. \"There are those who will tell you don\\'t cry. I\\'m not going to say that,\" Cummings said.

German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security, and had assessed the downing of the Ukrainian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. Earlier this month, the Dutch government - which lost 189 citizens in the disaster - said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted . to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it flew over Ukraine last July. After a meeting of foreign ministers from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the . sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, Holland's Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said there was general agreement on this course of action. Tragedy: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17 last year, and all 298 aboard were killed .

However, he sticks to the rest of his original story, saying he buried her in his garden with their beloved pets, which they called 'babies', because he thought it's what she would have wanted. He wrote: 'As I thought it was her choice I honoured her choice that night to bury her with our babies. 'I told everyone she had gone away...this was the only lie I told and I could not live with this lie so I went to the consulate and asked them to get the police.' He described the moment he found his wife's body in a pool of blood, claiming to have held the corpse for hours begging her to wake up before discovering the knife and a wound on her neck. Jackson is accused of murdering his wife at his home in Alvor, in the Algarve (pictured). At the time he denied causing her death, saying she had killed herself, but now says she died during a burglary . He also admits to moving his mistress of three years into the house as Mrs Davidson's body lay in the garden, but said the affair was no secret.

       " \"Listeners say the  last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions on the iPlayer service . It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’ Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’ Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes .

President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago.

One of the lucky few: First lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama welcome French President Francois Hollande for a State Dinner at the North Portico of the White House in February 2014 . Truman, who became president in 1945, held six dinners during nearly eight years in office. Shrouded in pageantry, a White House state dinner is the highest diplomatic honour the U.S. reserves for allies and other countries. It's also one of the most lavish affairs the government puts on. The State Department pays the entire tab, which averaged about $500,000 each for Obama's seven dinners, said White House spokesman Patrick Ventrell. Ventrell and others said cost was a concern when Obama took office in January 2009 amid the worst economic slide since the 1930s.

With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29 . The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return.

But which tipple is the best to bring out the flavour in fiery wasabi peas or salty sausage rolls? Wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing Pinot Grigio with nachos and Shiraz Rose with salt and vinegar crisps. A Riesling is the perfect companion to a sausage roll, Chardonnay goes great with wasabi peas or pittas and hummus, and Merlot is the best glass to compliment a box of chocolates. Tasters at Jacob's Creek sampled different types of wine with 10 of the nation's most popular snacks and light bites. They even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with Shiraz best for a margherita but a meaty Cabernet Sauvignon with a pepperoni. Meanwhile, Sauvignon Blanc was found to be the perfect pairing for salted popcorn and a Scotch Egg goes down a treat with a drop of Fiano. TV cook and author, Jo Pratt, who took part in the tasting session with Jacob's Creek wine maker Rebekah Richardson, said: 'There are plenty of guidelines out there about the best wines to drink with main meals but there isn't really any inspiration for which wines to enjoy with smaller plates or snacks. 'So it's brilliant to know you can now enjoy a delicious wine that perfectly complements the flavours of whatever you're eating. 'Whether that's a Sunday roast with all the family, or a well-deserved treat just for you, and wasabi peas and Chardonnay was a real eye opener.'

       " 'Peter Lawwell recently admitted to telling Ronny Deila that it was a matter of getting over the ‘Le Guen hump’ but Celtic’s chief executive might well have cited a couple of names that had met their grim fates closer to home. One thing is for sure: Deila did not need to be an ardent student of the history of Scottish football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season. By late autumn, his side had twice exited Europe while Hamilton Accies had left Celtic Park triumphant. A search party was hardly required to identify his doubters. Celtic manager\\xa0Ronny Deila admitted that the first six months in charge were mentally tough . Publicly, Deila plastered on the brave face and talked of looking behind the results for progress. Privately, the misgivings about his long-term suitability for the post were beginning to gnaw at him. ‘We played Dundee away (1-1) and we couldn’t play worse than we did,’ Deila recalled. ‘It was unbelievably bad. You know what the players want but you just haven’t got the message across. ‘People are insecure and that’s a hard time for the coach and the players.’ Even for a manager who had been steeped in the nuances of Scottish football, such a period would have been troubling enough. Deila, a Norwegian who had cut his teeth at tiny Stromsgodset, began to look like a man caught in entirely the wrong movie. ‘I have to admit the first six months were tough mentally because you have to really learn a lot of new things and get settled,’ he went on. ‘One thing is the language, the culture is another and then you have to know new opponents, your own team, understand what Celtic is all about and Scottish football. ‘There are so many things to take in and it’s so easy to push too hard and then you don’t get any time for reflection and you just get tired and then you can meet hard games and hard periods. You have nothing to push against.’ The Norwegian was unsure whether he was cut out to be the boss of the Bhoy',\n",

The Chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be ‘depriving more families’ of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, pictured visiting the Red Cone Cafe in Stourbridge, refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government’s austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you’ve already done in this Parliament?’ The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family’s annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000.

The Queensland teen is just one of many young Australians who have to seek permission from the Family Court and prove they are making an ‘independent’ choice before they can be granted second-stage gender-changing hormones. Currently a child wishing to change gender has to apply to the Family Court for this second stage of treatment after they have first taken puberty blocking hormones. Before a child is given any treatment at all they are assessed by at least five doctors. An official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which describes people who are significantly unhappy with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth, also needs to be given by psychologists and physicians.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom.

Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week . These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred \",\n",

Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock (pictured) in the mid-90s. Palaeontologists led by\\xa0Scott Persons (pictured) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones . Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. ‘Determining a dinosaur’s gender is really hard,’ said graduate student Scott Persons, who is lead author of the study, published in Scientific Reports. ‘Because soft anatomy seldom fossilises, a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female.’ So instead, the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. They suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates (illustrated), much like modern peacocks . The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. ‘My analysis of the t\",\n",

       " \"(CNN)I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of \",\n",

       " \"David Cameron will today warn English voters the SNP's new powers could impact their lives . David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government’s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an ‘unforeseen detrimental effect’ for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it ‘can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area’. Mr Cameron will call the idea the ‘Carlisle Principle’ – named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the ‘apartheid’ between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament’s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged – and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to ‘mark the Scottish Parliament’s homework’ every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK – and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of ‘English votes for English laws’, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron’s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year\",\n",

Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising.

For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV .

A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth\\'s atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light.

Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. Five days after Gray\\'s death and amid ongoing protests, police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest. Gray, who was stopped April 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes, should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest, said Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. A witness said the man was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. Batts told reporters in an afternoon news conference: \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" Investigators are trying to learn more about Gray\\'s condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station. At the first stop, Gray was placed in leg irons. The driver stopped a second time \"to deal with Mr. Gray and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" Davis said. The van stopped one more time to add a second prisoner. Batts told reporters that at the third stop an officer saw Gray on the floor of the van, asking for a medic. The officer and the van driver picked him up and put him on the seat, the commissioner said. When the van arrived at the Western District station, police called for an ambulance, said Davis, who is in charge of the investigation. An attorney for the Gray family said it was positive news, but there is a more important issue. \"It\\'s certainly a step towards acknowledging the truth that the police did not follow their own internal regulations,\" Jason Downs told CNN\\'s \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"What it does not get at is, it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did Mr. Gray need medical attention ',\n",

But even if that does not happen, Pardew, whose side host relegation strugglers Hull City on Saturday, is adamant that he will be backed by chairman Steve Parish. The former Newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in January and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens. Pardew added: ’To be honest, the chairman is as much banging on my door as I am his. The most important thing is we get good value.’ While Palace may seek to break the £7million club transfer record set with the September 2014 arrival of James McArthur from Wigan, Pardew is loath to do so lightly.

       " 'It’s a shame to see another talented young player being photographed taking ‘hippy crack.’ It might be legal but it’s still a drug. If you want to be a top athlete you don’t want that in your body. In a strange way, maybe this story will actually help keep Jack Grealish’s feet on the ground. He was outstanding against Liverpool but it was one game — he has not made it yet. Jack Grealish (left) has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxide . Grealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley . At Arsenal, Arsene Wenger changed the attitude completely. He said as professional athletes we had a duty to look after our bodies. Alcohol was described as poison — it slows down your body when it needs to be perfectly tuned. You eat what’s required to refuel, not for pleasure. Of course you still get players who want to enjoy themselves but there has to be a cut-off point. When I see Jack play it’s no surprise that he is full of confidence. He has a big future but he has to make the right choices. That’s how you make sure you are on the back pages, not the front. Emre Can of Liverpool tries to tackle Grealish during their FA Cup tie with Aston Villa at Wembley .',\n",

Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency.

Scroll down for video . CLAIM: MP Jesse Norman is being investigated by police over claims he attempted to 'bribe' voters with chocolate cake, pictured above . Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. The 57-year-old has criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous'  investigation after he was told he will face no further action. Mr Rose said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.'

       " 'Hong Kong (CNN)There\\'s a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it\\'s not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny\\'s cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying \\'fake\\' Jenny\\'s cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city\\'s main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the \"little bear cookies\" as they are known across Asia. People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage. A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner. The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example. In other parts of the world, food mania has erupted, swiftly winning people\\'s hearts and stomachs, only to fizzle out in a few months. From cronuts to ramen burgers, here are some foods that people around the world have spent hours of their lives waiting for. Were they worth it?',\n",
       " \"Easter is here! And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.' This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off . Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off . It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes. One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness . Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward . Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eatin\",\n",

On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won’t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport.

Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. \"The visit is prompted by UNRWA\\'s deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children,\" agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN\\'s Paula Newton.  \"Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict.\" Krähenbühl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.

The body was discovered at the West Colonial Drive home when an out-of-state family member called in a well-being check. WKMG\\xa0reports that an initial investigation determined there was foul play. 'My biggest concern is that he might come back,' said neighbor Natalie Randall, a resident of the Winter Garden RV Resort. An attorney for his estranged wife confirmed Shemansky's failure to appear for the scheduled visit. He is already on parole for battery on law enforcement, has a history of bipolar mental illness, and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for an attempted suicide. His mother was there to help him as he went through a divorce. His wife filed a domestic violence injunction against him two years ago, according to her attorney, Diana\\xa0Knowles Dunlop.

Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS.

But after Rustemi had dropped off his daughter at a different school, he returned to the crossing minutes later in a fit of temper and attacked Mr Doyle, who was still helping pupils cross the road.

Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, \"inadvertently\" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting. As deputies tried to handcuff Harris, Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand. He warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a Taser on the suspect, but instead, he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized, Clark said, citing a recently released video. Clark attributed Bates\\' actions to a phenomenon known as \"slip and capture.\" An example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission. The driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly, even though there\\'s no clutch pedal, he said. Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: \"These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction.\" Bates announced that he was going to deploy his Taser, and he pulled the trigger only once, as he was trained to do, Clark said.

       " 'Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama says he is \"absolutely committed to making sure\" Israel maintains a military advantage over Iran. His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country\\'s nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran\\'s economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu\\'s stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn\\'t \"have the luxury of testing these propositions\" in the deal. \"But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I\\'m willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them,\" Obama said. That, he said, should be \"sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table,\" he said. The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections. The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30. But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won\\'t have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country\\'s leadership isn\\'t trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are. Obama said even if Iran can\\'t be trusted, there\\'s still a case to be made for the deal. \"In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know ',\n",

Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster.

Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China\\'s runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities.

Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a 'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration.

Dildos have been found in some form throughout history, with Upper Palaeolithic artefacts previously discovered being said to be likely used for sexual pleasure. For thousands of years, phallic objects have been used symbolically as a means to boost fertility and ward off evil spirits - but their use as sexual aids has a long history, too. A 28,000-year-old phallus recently found in Germany is quoted as being the oldest known 'sex toy' ever found. While phalluses made from stone, wood, leather and even camel dung have all be found during excavations, or referenced throughout historical text and images.

He added: ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ A YouGov poll of 1,906 adults found that 50 per cent would support ‘people coming to live in the UK being banned from receiving treatment on the NHS for a period of five years’.\\xa0Another 34 per cent opposed such a ban.

Together with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, he tortured and murdered five children in Greater Manchester between 1963 and 1965. In 2013 a mental health tribunal ruled that Brady should stay at Ashworth, despite the notorious killer arguing that he was not suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and should go back to jail. Cregan, who lost an eye in a brawl, was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole in June 2013. He was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed the two policewomen after luring them to a house with a fake 999 call before shooting them 32 times on the doorstep and then throwing a grenade at them.

The hosting slot would have marked Clarkson's first appearance on the BBC since he was dismissed from Top Gear for hitting producer Oisin Tymon . His brash presenting style and refusal to bow to PC culture earned him legions of admirers and critics, and controversy dogged his career. He was put on a 'final warning' after allegedly saying a racial slur on air while reciting a nursery rhyme, and drew more unwanted attention after the Top Gear team were kicked out of Argentina last year while filming a Christmas special.

Last week, military and police forces helped evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said then. The seismic event is sure to add to the volume of ash already spewed since the first eruption. Ash spread to Argentina in the second eruption, which occurred a day after the first.

The armed forces could not immediately confirm if any of the rescued girls were among the 200 schoolgirls the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped in April 2014 from the village of Chibok. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the rescued girls and women are still being screened and none has spoken to their families yet. The 2014 mass abduction from Chibok led to an international social media movement, #BringBackOurGirls, to rescue them. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has been kidnapping females for years and has hundreds in their custody. Nigerian troops also captured and destroyed three terrorist camps in the Sambisa Forest, the armed forces said. Chibok and the Sambisa Forest are both in the northeastern part of the country. Olukolade said troops are still combing the forest. In recent weeks, Nigerian troops and vigilantes moved into the Sambisa Forest, a known hideout for Boko Haram.

But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by ‘new’ diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear rela\",\n",

His determination to prove himself, and justify the £16million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year £100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season.

Kenya's politicians and public have struggled with these ideas over and over. But the blood of 147 people slaughtered and 79 more injured, when Al-Shabaab opened fire at a college campus in Garissa on Thursday, has them debating them with renewed vigor. Many Kenyans had believed that security improved enough since Al-Shabaab held Nairobi's Westgate Mall under siege for four days in September 2013, resulting in the deaths of 67 people. Had it not, the massacre at Garissa University College would have been far worse, some say. Two police officers were on duty. But the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing Kenyans with self-doubt. With the highest death toll since the 1998 al Qaeda bombing on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, many are saying security is still not tight enough. And days after the attack authorities revealed that rapid response forces arrived hours late, allowing the killings to drag on. So what should Kenya do? The answer is elusive. The battle with Al-Shabaab is not a new one, and every attempt at countering them has only helped stall the inevitable -- another attack, more deaths. Here are some of the problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts. The notion of building a wall is somewhat grandiose, since the border runs some 700 kilometers or 435 miles. Even with a wall, militants could arrive by sea to coastal towns in Kenya that have been Islamist strongholds. The border crosses through remote areas, and many Somalis have fled their country south to Kenya. Garissa, for example is populated by mainly ethnic Somalis.

Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past.

During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader.

Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair’s popularity. Brookstein’s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It’s called The Forgotten Man.

The posting of the video comes in the wake of heavy storms which battered Sydney overnight, with parts of the city experiencing the heaviest rainfall in 100 years. A hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House has gone viral for the second time . Some users have referenced the weather as the trigger of the strange phenomenon, with musician Fortafy uploading the video with the following caption: 'storm brings out surfers in Sydney Harbour.' The video was originally posted by Sydneysider Darren Johnson following strong storms and tandem heavy swells in June 2012. YouTube commenters were quick to point out inaccuracies in the video, such as the appearance of rocks around the Opera House and the cardboard-esque appearance of the man in the final shot. It was also rebutted by several wave experts who vowed it was a sham. Ben Macartney, a swell forecaster, told\\xa0News.com 'the only way you'd get waves in there would be a giant tsunami coming out of the Pacific.' 'Even the most powerful ocean waves known to man, I think, would still really struggle to make it up there.'

Least favourite cheeses, according to a new survey, are Greek feta, French Camembert and American cream cheese. And while the French are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff, we are not far behind, with the average Briton eating their way through four servings a week. The research, which was conducted by pickle brand Branston also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics (26 per cent) admit to eating melted cheese with everything. A third of Brits (30 per cent) say they can't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish. In fact, three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail. If we're not putting slices in our sandwiches, one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting. Our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five (38 per cent) enjoying the ever versatile soft Italian cheese. Close behind in third place is traditional red Leicester (32 per cent).

But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm.

Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were ‘riddled with loopholes’ and may make tenants’ lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: ‘This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up. ‘Worse than this, Labour’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.’ In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether.

Throughout her incarceration, her family  stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges.

Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to \\xa0celebrate the news .

A crooked builder befriended a widowed pensioner so he could fritter away her £28,500 life savings on shopping sprees and lavish meals out. Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered the elderly woman's accounts before spending tens of thousands of pounds on trips to the Snowdome and in shops such as Argos and HMV. He even persuaded his victim to change her will so he could reap the benefits, before secretly taking out two life insurance policies, both of which named him as the beneficiary. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months after admitting charges of fraud and theft. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said Donohoe abused the woman's trust in 'every conceivable way'. Judge Francis Laird QC said: 'You befriended her, you became a close friend and confidante. Because of your behaviour towards her she absolutely trusted you with her financial affairs. 'You abused that trust. You did so in every conceivable way. She effectively handed over her money to you. You were not a financial advisor. 'However she was an elderly lady, a widow, alone and highly vulnerable to a dishonest individual such as yourself.' The court was told how Donohoe had first befriended the woman when he carried out work on her property in Tyseley in 2007. By January 2011, he had started controlling the woman's finances. During that time, he applied for credit cards in her name and also ran up huge debts. The court heard how the victim also changed her will twice during Donohoe's two-year scam, leaving everything to the defendant. But the widow was unaware that Donohoe had taken out the life insurance policies. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said Donohoe used the money on trips to the Snowdome as well as on meals and at shops. But Department of Work and Pensions checks soon discovered that the woman's accounts were overdrawn, \",\n",

And using images collected by the spacecraft, Nasa has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world. Using the map you can see a huge amount of features on Vesta, from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to ‘3D mode’ also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft. Called Vesta Trek, the interactive programme lets you explore massive craters on the body - which has no atmosphere, and thus no protection like our own Earth. Vesta, discovered in 1807, is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres - which Dawn has now travelled to. It completes a rotation every five hours and 18 minutes, with a temperature ranging from -3°C (27°F) to -188°C (-306°F). Some meteorites on Earth have been found to originate from places like Vesta. As you explore the asteroid, you will come across various ‘troughs’ - areas where the ground sinks away. The largest of these is up to 12 miles (20km) wide and 289 miles (465km) long, similar in size to the Grand Canyon on Earth. Elsehwere there are craters, hills and mountains on the surface, most formed by impacts. On the map you can switch between three main views - over the North Pole, a Global view or looking down onto the South Pole. Various tools also let you find out more information about the asteroid. You can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels, place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time, or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3D printer. There’s also an option to 3D print an entire model of Vesta. Nasa scientists in California have revealed an interactive 3D map for Vesta (shown) using images from the Dawn spacecraft.

       " '(CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn\\'t she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. \"Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?\" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn\\'t violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn\\'t this why rioting happens? I\\'m not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn\\'t exist. But Baltimore isn\\'t on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don\\'t see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don\\'t see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she\\'d told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn\\'t. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn\\'t take the chance that he\\'d stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And',\n",

True or False, Mercury is: . 1) The planet closest to the sun in our solar system . 2) So hot that water couldn't possibly exist there . 3) Something used in old-style glass thermometers . 4) A planet you don't think about very often . Answers: True, False, True (but not what we're talking about in this story) and I'm guessing No. 4 is true too. If you flunked the test, it might be because Mercury (the planet) suffers from bad (or very little) press. Or, maybe it's just bad lighting. Mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. Compare that to Earth -- we're about 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight. This may be one reason we don't think about it much. Venus, on the other hand, the planet between Earth and Mercury, appears to be the brightest planet in the sky. It's so bright it's been mistaken for an airplane. Pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking Venus for oncoming plane . But back to Mercury.

Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army.

Noise-induced hearing loss is\\xa0one of the most common work-related illnesses and members of the armed forces are\\xa0particularly vulnerable. In 2013, the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported hearing loss as one of the most common ailments among veterans receiving disability compensation. Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses, doctors have warned . Now, however, scientists at the University of Southern California believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition. They have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss. Their research, looking at the DNA of mice exposed to noise, is the first published genome-wide association study on noise-induced hearing loss in mice. As a result of the findings, those at higher, genetic risk for hearing loss can decide whether to take precautionary measures to protect their hearing prior to hazardous noise exposure, the study authors say. 'Understanding the biological processes that affect susceptibility to hearing loss due to loud noise exposure is an important factor in reducing the risk,' said lead study author Professor Rick Friedman. 'We have made great advances in hearing restoration, but nothing can compare to protecting the hearing you have and preventing hearing loss in the first place.' Scientists have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss .

Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas . Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something . And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.' The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said. 'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said.

The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. \"This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,\" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance.

More than 10,000 people have arrived from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between North Africa and Italy; boat people have been arriving on Italy\\'s islands for more than a decade. But what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation, specifically those in Libya, because when Moammar Gadhafi was in control, he also controlled the flow of migrant ships. In 2008, the-then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi  signed an historic friendship agreement in which Italy promised to invest $5 billion in Libyan infrastructure and Gadhafi promised to close what he described as a \"spigot\" of migrants. During a three-day state visit to Italy in August 2010, he famously threatened to \"turn Europe black\" if Libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the European Union. After the agreement, Gadhafi  kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased. For a time, almost all migrant arrivals came from Tunisia, just 70 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because Italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to Tunisia, the flow eventually tapered off. And once a new Tunisian government was in place, after the Arab Spring, Italy signed an accord with Tunisia in which they promised to help patrol Tunisia\\'s ports.

After training at the University of Cambridge and Harvard Law School, he qualified as a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a QC in 1971.

For nearly 25 years, however, a shadow has hung over Lord Janner of Braunstone in the same way it did Cyril Smith and a string of other establishment figures.

For 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature's back while he chatted to him, and never once felt as though he was in danger. Rangers had already been trying to capture Gregory, who had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, 70 kilometres south of Cairns for years, when they asked for Mr Tabone's help. Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship . 'He was on the run for a couple of years, he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows,' Mr Tabone told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cattle used to come down there and have a drink and Gregory used to grab them by the nose and drown them,' he said. Mr Tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature, in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc. 'They had a trap for a couple of years but he just didn't go in, and after a certain amount of time, you know, there's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this,' he said. 'They (National Parks) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him.' The farmer who owned the property where Gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of Mr Tabone and, helped by some 'freak weather', they were finally able catch the reptile. A heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait, which Gregory then followed. Gregory was captured my Mr Tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer's cattle . 'Three weeks later, water was down to about ankle-deep and I looked hard in the murky water and I said there's this great big massive animal in there,' Mr Tabone revealed.

Doubt has been cast on Labour's commitment to the deterrent because Mr Miliband could be forced to rely on the SNP support to form a government. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster.

Her comments raise the prospect of Mr Miliband ending up in Number 10 as a result of nationalist support despite having fewer seats in the House of Commons than the Tories. Miss Sturgeon’s latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a French diplomat she wanted David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister. The report of the conversation, on February 26, between Miss Sturgeon and Sylvie Bermann, the French Ambassador, was contained within a Scotland Office memo leaked to the Daily Telegraph. The claim was denied both by the French embassy and Miss Sturgeon. Miss Sturgeon also denied a separate claim in the memo that Mr Miliband is ‘not Prime Minister material’. It undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office.

He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head, which was left there for nine weeks. Billy Mitchell, seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes malformations . The surgeries carried risks including meningitis, brain damage, catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death, but Billy pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face. Billy’s mother, Denise Mitchell, 47, said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born. ‘When I saw him I had an overwhelming sense of love. But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,’ she said. ‘I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.’ It was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. Children with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes.

Small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant, known as Mary, who died suddenly in 2013, after a lengthy stay in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby's vulnerability. According to a report, Mary's family, who lived in Liverpool, were well-known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child neglect. A school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up.

Her parents came to the attention of social care unit Careline five times between 2008 and 2012.

       " 'Washington (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight. Roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry. The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century, and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race. Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage, but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation\\'s highest court, led by Roberts. Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. He dissented in United States v. Windsor, a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. And he\\'s expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans. Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice, and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally. They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he\\'ll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again. \"If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality, the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court,\" said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is advocating for same-sex marriage. \"Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision?\" For some conservatives, a vote in favor of same-sex marriage ',\n",

The tuxedo lapel frames your face and is very slimming. Style it with over a white sleeveless flared dress for some virginal innuendos for a first date or throw it over ripped jeans for a more casual SoHo artisty look.

       " 'The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per',\n",

That\\'s what happened,\" Minatel told CNN\\'s Paula Newton moments after the incident. She was seated four rows behind Minatel, a professional soccer player traveling with his team. The incident occurred about a half-hour before the flight landed, after the pilots had begun their descent. \"I forced it (the cord) down and then other people came to help, and then I got out and he started saying that we were here to kill him,\" Minatel said. The man was not restrained for the rest of the trip, but the flight crew told him to stay seated with his seat belt on. The man kept trying to get out of his seat but other passengers yelled at him whenever he tried to stand up. The two-hour flight landed at Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield airport at about 4:30 p.m.  where it was met by U.S. authorities.  The suspect was escorted off the plane. An FBI spokesman confirmed the agency responded to the incident. \"The passenger, however, was transported for medical/mental evaluation under the direction and coordination of the Atlanta Police Department,\" Special Agent Stephen Emmett said. \"While there are currently no federal charges pending, the facts of the matter are being relayed to the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Atlanta.\" Minatel, a forward from Brazil, was traveling with his teammates from the Ottawa Fury Football Club of the second-division North American Soccer League.

       " \"Anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change. Scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as Antarctica and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade. The gases - desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide. Anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery (above) but it may also be warming the planet . Atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low, they are having an increasing effect on the climate. Dr Martin Vollmer, who led the study at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology in Dubendorf, Switzerland, said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide. The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. Researchers have found evidence that suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1°C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25°C per decade, give or take 0.05°C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years.

Twitter, of course, is abuzz: Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far? Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he\\'d like? From the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he\\'s promoting his latest film, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug. His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he\\'s much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, \"Do I really have to sit here with this guy?\" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, \"Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.\" But it\\'s after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is \"free from all of that,\" referring to Downey\\'s history of \"taking drugs, drinking\" that the building tension comes to a head. \"I\\'m sorry,\" says Downey, \"What are we doing?\" To which Guru-Murthy replies, \"I\\'m just asking questions,\" which indeed was so.

Pochettino said: ‘When players get their first call-up, they try to show they are good enough and try to impress the national manager, and because they are over-motivated they expend a lot of energy. ‘When you come back to the team, the consequence is that for two or three weeks you are a little bit down.

The 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects’ scale-covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their Greek order name of Lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves.

According to Paris prosecutor\\'s spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor\\'s office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage.

Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story.

Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there\\'s little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it\\'s time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. ',\n",

Now, at the age of 64, he's facing criminal charges. Japanese police say they arrested the man, Yuhei Takashima, on Wednesday over allegations he photographed an obscene act with a girl of 13 or 14 and produced pornography in a hotel room in Manila, the Philippine capital. Police officers seized 147,600 photos that Takashima took of his activities over the years, said Takeshi Akimoto, the police officer in charge of crime involving minors in Kanagawa, a prefecture south of Tokyo. The pictures were kept in more than 400 photo albums, he said. Takashima, who comes from the city of Yokohama, told police that he began paying for sex with women in 1988 when he went to work at a Japanese school in Manila. He said that stepping outside of moral codes relieved the heavy pressure he felt at work, according to police. Takashima told police that he continued to pay for sex because it was so cheap. After the end of his three-year stint at the school in Manila, he frequently returned to the Philippines on vacations in order to buy sex. He said the ages of the prostitutes he hired ranged from 14 to over 70. The Philippines is a notorious destination for sex tourists, including pedophiles. The country's sex industry is tied to human trafficking and feeds off the high poverty rate. Akimoto, the police officer, said Takashima's case had been under investigation since 2013. The incident for which he was arrested is believed to have taken place in Manila in January 2014. Yokohama education authorities said that Takashima became a junior high school teacher in 1975 and was sent to work at the school in Manila between 1988 and 1991. He served as a junior high school principal from 2008 until his retirement in 2011. The education authorities said that the\",\n",

Experts blame increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an obsession with mobile phones for a sharp rise in the number of young people with back and neck problems. And they warn that children as young as 12 are seeking treatment. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure . Some 45 per cent of the under-30s surveyed for the British Chiropractic Association said they had a painful back or neck – up from 28 per cent last year. Across all age groups, 86 per cent said it was a problem – compared with 77 per cent last year. Almost one in four said that they are in pain on a daily basis. Chiropractors blame the increase on days and nights spent sitting hunched over mobile phones and tablet computers. Rishi Loatey, a chiropractor in North-West London, sees patients who are still at school, including some as young as 12. He said working on laptops and tablets rather than desktop computers, as well as using mobile phones, can affect posture and put the back under extra strain. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure.

According to the report, household names like CBS, General Electric and Mattel all successfully manipulated the U.S. tax code to avoid paying taxes on their massive profits. Even more shocking: some of them even received tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions. Avoidance: Fifteen Fortune 500 companies managed to get through 2014 without owing a penny in income taxes. What's more, most of those 15 were actually given federal tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions . CBS made\\xa0$1.8 billion in U.S. profits last year and received a $235 million tax rebate . To put this harsh reality into perspective, imagine you're a taxpayer logged on to a tax site in your struggle to determine what you owe Uncle Sam. You pay upwards of $100 every month for the internet you're using and could well owe thousands in income tax. But if your monthly internet payment goes to Time Warner, guess what they'll be paying this year. That's right: zero dollars. In a way, you may have paid them. Again. The frequently maligned cable company made over $4 billion in U.S. profit last year and subsequently received tax rebates totaling $26 million. And, as Fast Company notes, it's all perfectly legal. One method used by these companies is called accelerated depreciation, which means the tax value of an asset may be claimed in the first years of the purchase rather than over time. Another method of tax avoidance is active financing. Put simply, this means a company classifies a taxable activity as foreign financing, putting it out of reach of the IRS. With corporate giants like Pepco, Prudential and Xerox all successfully avoiding paying income tax, Citizens for Tax Justice says American taxpayers and the U.S. government need to wake up and amend the tax code.

Rony John, 15, died after jumping into the River Great Ouse in Hartford, Cambridgeshire, despite being unable to swim. At an inquest into his death, the coroner said she would now write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education.

       " '(CNN)Have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time, or thought you were having that long-awaited problem-solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep? According to neuroscientists John Kounios and Mark Beeman, there\\'s a reason for that. Their book, \"The Eureka Factor\", explores the influences at work behind that much sought-after \"Aha!\" moment. Research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration, most of us end up suppressing it. The book explains how to clear out mental junk, in order to make way for pivotal revelations. Dr. Kounios explained: \"Insights involve unusual connections. Cognitive psychologists call these \\'remote associations\\'. They are processed mostly in the brain\\'s right hemisphere. Insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness. This is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain\\'s right temporal lobe.\" \"We wrote \"The Eureka Factor\" to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other, \" said Kounios. \"For example, there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state. However, if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious, then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer.\" \"That said, a positive mood and a broad, expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state,\" he added. Following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work. Spaciousness helps broaden thoughts. Even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention. Small, windowless offices, low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible, creative thinkers. Relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state. \"Emergency\" colors such as red suppress it. Surprisingly, dark',\n",

Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas.

       " 'TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP £16.99) Testosterone doesn’t always get a good press. Everything that’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It’s all testosterone’s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. ‘Without our father’s testosterone,’ as he writes, ‘none of us would exist.’ It has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it’s essential. Although this is the case and it’s impossible to think of ‘maleness’ without testosterone, it’s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly ‘female’ hormone. However, it’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father’s. We don’t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone’s power then recedes, but returns — and how! — in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone’s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculi',\n",

Doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily, UN officials warn. They say the procedure should only be carried out when ‘medically necessary’ because it can lead to infections and even death. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally. But last night experts from the World Health Organisation, the UN’s public health agency, said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent, due to the dangers and costs involved. In a statement, they said: ‘Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at risk of short- and long-term health problems.’ They added that the procedure can lead to ‘significant complications, disability or death’ and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients. A planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369, compared to a natural birth at £1,665. The WHO statement sharply contradicts current NHS guidelines, which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification. The watchdog NICE issued revised recommendations in 2011 allowing women to have the operation if they were very anxious about childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s .

Chokalingam had spent his college years as a \"hard-partying frat boy,\" and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that \"black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance.\" This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to \"dramatically improve\" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his \"long Indian-American eyelashes,\" checked \"black\" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname \"JoJo.\" He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that',\n",

Adele Berry has told of her shock after she was bombarded with texts from a Vodafone call centre worker . Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her.

Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a £341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque  was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified.

'From Silverstone next week, you will see that for any race we will do - no grid girls like in the past,' WEC chief executive Gerard Neveu said after a presentation on Thursday for the opening Silverstone six-hour race. The world endurance championship have announced that there will be no more 'grid girls' before races . The decision by the FIA is seen as a progressive one by those in a male-dominated sport . 'For me that is the past. The condition of women is a little bit different now,' he said. The use of models, also referred to as 'race queens' or 'umbrella girls', to stand by cars with flags or placards displaying drivers' numbers has long been a feature of Formula One. It has also been a bone of contention for those seeking more equality and less sexism in a male-dominated sport, although in some series where women racers have joined the grid the 'umbrella' role has been taken by a man. The Hawiian Tropic Girls arrive on the grid before the start of the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 2001 . Toyota's world champion Anthony Davidson said it was about time things changed.

Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees 'overwhelmingly supported' and 'preferred' the proposals.

       " '(CNN)The first trailer for a documentary on the life and music of late British singer Amy Winehouse was released Thursday. The teaser for \"Amy: The Girl Behind the Name,\" set for UK release on July 3, features early footage of Winehouse talking about how her music career was born and where she believed she was headed. \"Singing has always been important to me, but I never thought, \\'I\\'ll end up singing\\' or \\'I\\'ll be a singer,\\' \" Winehouse said. \"I felt like I had nothing new that was coming out at the time that really represented me or the way I felt, so, you know, I just started writing.\" Winehouse, known for her bluesy voice, bouffant hairdo and numerous tattoos, struggled publicly with drugs and alcohol during a career in which she recorded two albums and won six Grammys (one posthumous). She died from alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011. Her biggest hit, \"Rehab,\" chronicled the efforts of those around her to get her to submit to substance abuse treatment. \"Amy\" seeks to \"truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn\\'t get a chance to know,\" the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013. Amy Winehouse documentary gets UK release date . The trailer conveys Winehouse\\'s ambivalence about fame. \"I\\'m not a girl trying to be a star or trying to be anything other than a musician,\" she says. \"I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna be at all famous,\" Winehouse tells an interviewer early in her career. \"I don\\'t think I could handle it. I would probably go mad. Do you know what I mean? I would go mad.\" A life cut short: Remembering the tragedy of Amy Winehouse . Unlike an earlier look at the singer\\'s life, 2013\\'s \"Fallen Star,\" the documentary has been endorsed by Winehouse\\'s family.

Virgil van Dijk's sublime 16th free-kick gave the Parkhead side a dream start to their Scottish Cup semi-final clash with Inverness. But the Parkhead side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2-0 ahead before half-time when additional assistant Alan Muir failed to spot a goalline handball from Josh Meekings. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Josh Meekings and award his side a penalty . Celtic's anger was further fuelled when McLean - rightly - sent off Parkhead keeper Craig Gordon for clattering into Marley Watkins in 53 minutes, Greg Tansey equalising from the spot. A man down for 67 minutes the Scottish champions wilted in extra-time, succumbing to goals from Edward Ofore and David Raven, despite John Guidetti making it 2-2. In measured tones, Deila chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying: 'I don't think I have to say much about that. 'I think everybody can see what's happening. The Inverness defender (6) handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . 'When they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game. 'But, of course, with ten it gets more difficult and we have to run more.

The result is his very own \\'Pie-egg-ra\\' dish - Creme Egg oozing from the traditional pie casing which is then served with chips to more adventurous customers at a price of £2.75.

John Clarkson in his chip shop\\xa0Mr Eaters Fish and Chips in Preston, Lancashire . The 55-year-old fryer, says the savoury-sweet mix is a hit with customers, who have taken to dipping chips into the Creme Egg \\'yolk\\' like traditional toast soldiers. The pie was created by blind-baking the casing as the egg would otherwise melt down, . Then one-and-a-half Creme Eggs were popped in as a filling. A lid is put on to seal the dish before the pie is battered and fried until golden, . And if the timings are expertly observed, the chocolate will just begin to soften in the middle. Mr Clarkson, who runs Mr Eaters Fish and Chips in Preston, Lancashire, said: \\'I love Easter and I love Creme Eggs but I thought it would be fun to try and put my own spin on them. \\'Everyone has heard of battered Mars Bars by now so I thought, \"what would be the next step up?\" Mr Clarkson rolls out the pie casing (left) before stuffing one and a half Creme Eggs into it (right) The pie is then covered with a lid and dipped in batter (left) before being quickly deep fried (right) \\'Creme Eggs are just the right size and shape to be placed in a pie, so I thought \\'why not?\\' \\'It\\'s a laugh and I always like seeing what I can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual.

The businessman who brought KFC to the UK but has only ever eaten it once, says he will not go again and branded the fast-food chain 'dreadful.' Raymond Allen - who is only a handful of people in the world to know its secret recipe - opened the first franchise in Preston, Lancashire, in 1965. He had become a personal friend of Harland 'the Colonel' Sanders after meeting during a conference in Chicago 50 years ago. Mr Allen still has a personal hand-written copy of the recipe which is believed to be made up of 11 herbs and spices - and is a closely guarded secret by the firm. But the 87-year-old, from Jersey in the Channel islands, said the company has strayed so far from its original concept it's been 'ruined' and would never set foot in one again. He said: 'We have got one where I now live, but I would not go in there. I don't use it and I think it is dreadful. The company has ruined the product. 'Instead of staying with one good thing that was sellable, they have tried to compete with the other fast food units. They should have just stuck with the chicken.' His wife Shirley, 84, said: 'We tried KFC only once about a year ago. 'We had the traditional original chicken but there were so many different products it was difficult to know what to order. I don't think we will go back.' After the chance meeting in Chicago, Mr Allen helped Sanders establish the UK side of his empire while he was still a small-time restaurant owner in Louisville, Kentucky. He also gave him valuable advice on the legal side of the business including patents and was paid to seek out suitable locations for other branches across the world.

It comes in a yellow-labeled bottle with a fire-breathing demon on it. It tastes like Big Red chewing gum. It\\'s Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, and lately it\\'s been as hot as its name. \"Fireball is number one, definitely. That\\'s pretty much the chosen shot,\" said Belue, who enjoys it herself now and then. \"On an average night, we probably go through three or four bottles.\" If you\\'re young -- say, under 35 -- this may not be news to you. Fireball, which didn\\'t exist in its current form a decade ago, is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in America. Retail sales more than doubled last year, and Fireball has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the U.S. as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose. And these figures don\\'t include sales in bars, where Fireball has dethroned Jagermeister as America\\'s party shot of choice. Or social media feeds, which fill with photos of Fireball-flavored revelry and #FireballFriday hashtags. \"Fireball is an incredible phenomenon. The growth of it has just been astounding,\" said Lew Bryson, managing editor of Whisky Advocate and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits. \"For a whiskey, this is unprecedented.\" To the uninitiated, Fireball is basically made from Canadian whisky, aged in used bourbon barrels, flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon. (The \"whisky\" spelling generally refers to Scotches or Canadian varieties, while \"whiskey\" refers to Irish or American styles.) Its slogan is \"Tastes like heaven, burns like hell,\" but that\\'s an exaggeration.

Five days after their first airstrikes, the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the Houthis and supporters of Yemen\\'s longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable, a Saudi source said. Saudi Arabia\\'s navy now controls all Yemeni ports, allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade, according to the source.

       " '(CNN)Are we alone in the cosmos? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere? Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA\\'s Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed \"exoplanets,\" and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the \"habitable zone\" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet\\'s surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Of course, there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals, which appeared about 200 million years ago. And then the humans, who have existed for only 200,000 years. Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth.

If the man who shot President Reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good, he should have to live under strict conditions, wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a GPS tracking device, government lawyers said on Thursday.

Scott Stephenson had been due to be jailed for the incident after admitting theft, but he skipped bail until he was arrested and sent back to court. The 19-year-old, from South Shields,  rifled through his 22-year-old unnamed victim's pockets and made off with the iPhone 4. His victim had tripped and fallen unconscious on the cold December day.

Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier\\'s policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean.

Robert Preston Boardwine provided his friend Joyce Rosemary Bruce with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010. She had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean Mr Boardwine had no parental rights. After the boy was born, the pair disagreed on the level of involvement Mr Boardwine would have in his son's life, with Ms Bruce intent on raising him alone. Unusual method: A court in Richmond, Virginia, has ruled that even though Joyce Rosemary Bruce impregnated herself using a turkey baster and Robert Preston Boardwine's sperm, he still has parental rights . Mr Boardwine had envisioned being more involved in the child's life, telling a lower court he had hoped to 'attend the boy's sporting events some day', and have a say in major decisions such as school. The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that as the child's biological father, Mr Boardwine is more than a sperm donor and is entitled to be a part of his son's life. 'The path to fatherhood may have been unconventional,' the court said, but it doesn't remove Boardwine's parental rights. According to court filings, Ms Bruce impregnated herself with a turkey baster, believing that Mr Boardwine would not have any parental rights because they did not have intercourse. Mr Boardwine had agreed after some trepidation to provide the sperm, and the pair underwent several tries before Ms Bruce fell pregnant. They discussed a written contract but never signed one, a court heard. 'Bruce used an ordinary turkey baster to inseminate herself,' the court said. 'No other person was involved.

This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress.

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers.

An Uber driver in San Francisco has been charged with assault after ramming into a cyclist who was shouting at him, leaving the biker with several broken bones, police and media reported. The incident occurred in the busy Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco when the cyclist rode up to the vehicle, yelled at the driver, banged on his window and pushed in his mirror, police spokesman Carlos Manfredi told AFP. 'During the exchange the cyclist sped up and the vehicle also sped up, striking the back of the bike,' Manfredi said. 'The cyclist sustained a punctured lung, broken ribs and a broken clavicle,' he added. The driver, Emerson Decarvalho, 38, stayed at the scene of the crash and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after the incident, which took place Sunday afternoon. He was also charged with failing to maintain a three-foot (one meter) space between his car and the cyclist. Uber offered to help in the investigation of the incident. 'Our thoughts are with the victim of this terrible incident. We are gathering more information, have reached out to the San Francisco Police Department and will assist their investigation however we can,' said Uber spokeswoman Kate Downen. Uber said there was no passenger in the vehicle at the time. The San Francisco Chronicle newspaper said the cyclist was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital.

They claimed the Church was being ‘turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged’, and said it presented a ‘slow-burning crisis’.

Called the Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, it was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets. On Earth, however, it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot, as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph. Watch the buggy in action below . Unlike a normal car, the buggy has\\xa0no mechanical linkages to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators, the driver of an MRV relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle's motors. A turn of the steering wheel, for instance, is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle. These computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate, causing the vehicle to turn as commanded. Nasa says the vehicles was buit 'in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on Earth.' 'With seating for two people, MRV is a fully electric vehicle well-suited for busy urban environments, it says. MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners. Each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator, a passive trailing arm suspension, an in-wheel propulsion motor, and a motor-driven friction braking system. Each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated ±180 degrees about its axis. This allows for a suite of driving modes allowing MRV to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road. In addition to conventional front two wheel steering, the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni-directional, crab-like motion. This makes a ma\",\n",

And it says that amateur astronomers could help with its 'unprecedented' search for ET by accessing research data online. Scroll down for video . The Nexss team, includes those who study Earth as a life-bearing planet (lower right), those researching the diversity of solar system planets (left), and those on the new frontier, discovering worlds orbiting other stars in the galaxy (upper right) The initiative, dubbed Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (Nexss), will include scientists from 10 universities including Stanford, the University of California and Yale. The study of exoplanets is a relatively new field, and began with the discovery of the first exoplanet around a star like our sun in 1995. Since the launch of the Kepler space telescope six years ago, more than 1,000 exoplanets have been found, with thousands of additional candidates waiting to be confirmed. Nasa has set up a website for the public called Planet Hunters which allows anyone to search the data gathered by Kepler, which launched six years ago. Scientists are also developing new ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search for biosignatures, or signs of life. During a talk last month, Nasa said humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade.

SUNSCREEN . There can be few of us who haven’t dug out half-full bottles of SPF30 from the previous year or, indeed, many years past, and wondered whether it’s still OK to slather on. But a recent survey revealed that almost three-quarters of UK holidaymakers are at risk of UV exposure because they use out-of-date sun cream. Many experts recommend that we wear sunscreen every day all year round for anti-ageing purposes. Certainly now the weather is heating up, damaging UVA and UVB rays will be stronger. So, can we use old suncreams? ‘Sun cream contains UV filters which fall into two main categories: synthetic or organic filters, which absorb UV light; and mineral or inorganic filters, such as titanium dioxide, which mainly reflect UV light. Frequently, both types are used in combination,’ says Dr Chris Flower of the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association).

(Chatto & Windus £16.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker’s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience.

That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA’s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel’s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness’ legal representative that they weren’t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: ‘Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings’ solicitor. ‘In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . ‘The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. ‘It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident ',\n",

       " '(CNN)Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia\\'s actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran\\'s steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani\\'s open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels.

Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers\\' words, that\\'s the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns.  The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\"  The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest.

Council chiefs were condemned last night after claiming it was too dangerous to collect the roadside litter blighting Britain. Winchester Council in Hampshire said its annual clean-up of roads around the city had been hit by new Health and Safety Executive rules designed to protect litter-pickers from traffic. But the HSE denied tightening rules – and said councils were ‘over-interpreting’ legislation. Last night, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion, now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, accused town hall bosses and the Highways Agency of ruining the countryside by failing to remove rubbish. He said: ‘Every day, people tell us that they are disgusted, angry and ashamed of the state of England’s roads. ‘Nobody wants to drive through our beautiful countryside or approach a vibrant city, heralded only by discarded rubbish.’ Although laws to fine people who throw litter from vehicles were now in place, their implementation had been delayed by ‘shameful time-wasting’, Sir Andrew said. ‘Without funding to tackle the problem, I fear our roads will become corridors of waste,’ he added. Highways England – the Government-owned company launched last week to replace the Highways Agency – is required to keep the motorway network clean, but responsibility for clearing A-roads and trunk routes is divided between the agency and councils.

In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,\\xa0@AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had i\",\n",

       " '(CNN)Would you build a house with water? Hungarian architect Matyas Gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature. And while that doesn\\'t mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks, cement, and plaster, his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering. Gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of Kecskemet, south of Budapest, with his high school friend Milan Berenyi, after years of research and development. The house was built with a grant from the EU, and showcases the \"liquid engineering\" concepts Gutai has written about extensively. Panels, some of steel, and some of glass, make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers, which equalizes the temperature across the building. The house is actually able to reheat itself, when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage, to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops. The indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating. This is a very efficient and sustainable system: the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers, which could reduce carbon emissions. \"Our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating,\" says Gutai. \"It saves energy, when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it\\'s a very clean and sustainable solution.\" While studying sustainable architecture at the University of Tokyo, in 2003, Gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths. Despite the snowfall outside the pool, Gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water\\'s surface temperature and its potential use in architecture. \"As an architect I think it\\'s really important that this building tries to redefine permanence, which has ',\n",

German detectives have been ‘closely monitoring developments’ in the £60 million London case and are expected to make contact with Scotland Yard this week. In particular, they are keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and, crucially, whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a £8.3 million robbery at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged . In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013 . There has been speculation that the London robbers – who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit centre – are from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, it is believed the Volksbank raiders, who have never been caught, are Polish. One of the five-man gang left a book at the crime scene – a Polish translation of American Desperado, the autobiography of drug smuggler Jon Roberts. And wooden boards used for their 100ft tunnel were bought in Poland. Thomas Neuendorf, of Berlin Police, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are very interested in the case in England and I’m sure our investigators will get in touch… If DNA matching our samples is put into the Interpol database by Scotland Yard we will be immediately notified.’ Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid . In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday . In the German case, the gang spent almost a year',\n",

But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause.

'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose.

Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison.

Members Rick Parfitt (pictured left) and Francis Rossi (right) Katherine Jenkins will be\\xa0West End star Elaine Paige, boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe . Other stars include boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe. The 1940s-themed concert will take place on Saturday 9 and will be broadcast on BBC1, hosted by Chris Evans. The singers will be joined by four Strictly Come Dancing couples and readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks. The extensive commemoration is a victory for the Daily Mail which highlighted growing concerns that the anniversary risked being overshadowed by the election on May 7. Singer Dame Vera Lynn, the 98-year-old Forces’ Sweetheart, was among those who called on the Government to do more to mark the occasion. It is likely to be the last major anniversary which will be attended in strength by the generation that fought at home and abroad during the war. David Cameron asked Cabinet minister William Hague in February to draw up plans for three days of national commemorations and last month Chancellor George Osborne earmarked up to £2million in the Budget towards marking the event. The timing of the anniversary makes it even more of an extraordinary occasion, starting the day after a general election which is likely to result in another hung Parliament. The 1940s-themed concert will also include readings from Pointless host Al',\n",
       " \"A 17 stone mother who was left red faced after becoming trapped in a fairground ride has shed almost half her body weight after taking to the treadmill. Shauna McGlasson, 25, from Workington, was so overweight she got trapped in the turnstiles at the Alice And Wonderland ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in August last year. Shauna, who was a takeaway addict, was carrying her three-year-old daughter Lacey in her arms at the time and the toddler started screaming after her mother tried to free herself. Shauna\\xa0McGlasson was left red faced after becoming trapped in the turnstiles of the Alice and Wonderland ride when she took her daughter Lacey (pictured) to Blackpool Pleasure Beach after ballooning to 17st . It was this embarrassing incident that inspired the mother-of-one to make a dramatic change to her diet and exercise routine losing 7st in as many months . This was the final straw for the full-time mum who had been left battling depression and anxiety after gorging on fast-food and ballooning to 17 stone. Determined Shauna has since dropped seven stone and now weighs in at just over 10 stone. Shauna made fast progress as she began to eat healthily, she lost four stone in as many months reaching 13st by December, 2014. She then hit the gym and shifted another three stone and has started a new relationship with boyfriend Curtis Grayson, 21. Before shedding the weight Shauna battled with depression because of her size . And 5ft 2in Shauna insists she's never been happier. She says if she had not got stuck in that ride her life would never have changed for the better. 'I was addicted to takeaways and I've never felt so low,' she said. 'When we got to go through to the ride I got stuck in the turnstile and Lacey started crying. 'Everyone was looking at me and I felt so humiliated so I had to do something about it. 'You can see in the photo taken when I finally got out just how upset Lacey is.' Shauna swapped her daily treats of chips and pizza for a high protein diet o\",\n",

       " \"A prolific gang of thieves who carried out early morning raids on multi-million pound mansions to steal cash, jewellery and luxury cars  have been jailed for a total of 17 years. Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah treated burglary 'like a job, a profession,' raiding houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes, taking a Ferrari, Porches, Minis, paintings and cash worth £1million, often waiting until home owners were on holiday before striking. Sayed Juied, 32, and\\xa0Sadek Miah, 31,  were jailed for six years each after admitting to raiding 21 muti-million pound homes in west London, Hertfordshire and Surrey . The gang were undeterred by security systems, officers said, instead viewing them as a sign a property was worth raiding. If they found that valuables were locked in a safe inside, they would simply cut the safe out, before cracking it open later. Officers first began hunting the group in July last year after a raid on a £2.6million house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, next door to the Lawn Tennis Association. Mohammed Alam, 26, was give five years. Police said the gang treated robbery as 'a profession', surveying properties before they struck . The raiders smashed in a back window before ransacking the property, taking keys to a £30,000 Porsche Cayenne and a £20,000 Mini Cooper, along with £13,000 of jewellery and electrical items. The house was so badly damaged the owners also had to foot a £13,000 repair bill. A week later the gang struck two neighbouring homesin Putney, including one £4.6million house, taking jewellery worth £38,700, and a Porsche Cayenne worth £75,000. Continuing their all-night burglary spree, they hit another Putney home  where they stole a personalised Ferrari worth £280,000, a matching Cayenne worth £130,000, and a painting worth nearly £50,000.

       " \"Conflicting stance: Ed Miliband, pictured during a speech yesterday, will today announce a 'clear, credible plan' on immigration . Ed Miliband will today claim Labour’s attitude to immigration has ‘changed’ – despite still refusing to put any upper limit on the numbers allowed in. In an audacious move, the Labour leader will insist that he offers a ‘clear, credible and concrete plan on immigration – not false promises’. He will say: ‘We will deal with people’s concerns because we have listened, we have learned and we have changed.’ But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration. Under intense pressure during a home affairs debate on the BBC’s Daily Politics Show, Yvette Cooper would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current 300,000. Presenter Andrew Neil had pointed out that, in office, Labour had ‘virtually opened the door’ to record migration. During Labour’s 13 years in power, the foreign-born population rocketed by 3.6million. Home Secretary Theresa May, trading blows with Ms Cooper in the debate, said: ‘The choice is clear. Back to a Labour Home Office which they admitted was not fit for purpose, or the Conservatives, who have a plan to reform free movement, cut immigration, defeat extremism and keep cutting crime.’ The Tories are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Speaking in the Vale of Glamorgan today, Mr Miliband will claim that Labour would implement a ten-point plan for curbing immigration during its first 100 days in office. It includes recruiting an additional 1,000 border staff, banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers. However, the Tories are likely to point out that a number of the proposals are already in the process of being implemented. They include \",\n",
       " \"(CNN)It's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas w\",\n",
